# enphase

This is a fork from https://github.com/vincentwolsink/home_assistant_enphase_envoy_installer
Testing, adjusting for personal goals.. using it on homeassistant for the D7 firmware versions using HACS.

The v1.0 version is based on the v2.1 from Vincent but with a alot of adjustments and i removed the "battery funcations" and "grid status", which i don't use.
